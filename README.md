This Arduino project contains the source code for our control hardware in the Play "Besessen" presented at Theater Dortmund.

It contains a simple Arduino Nano for controlling pneumatic solenoids via buttons and an external RF receiver.

The solenoid valves are attached to a bedframe on the stage to let it shake.

Premiere: 23. October 2015
